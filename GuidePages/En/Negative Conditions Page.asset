  name: Negative Conditions in Constructions
  content: In the conditions of constructions, you can write a negative condition.
    That is, instead of, for example, <color=red><if (left obstacle)></color>, you
    can write <color=red><if (no obstacle left)></color>. And the robot, in this
    case, will instead check for the presence of an obstacle on the left, on the
    contrary, check for its absence
