  name: Enemies and attack command
  content: 'In some levels you will encounter hostile robots. If you get too close
    to them, they will attack and break Win. To avoid this, you need to write in
    the construction condition, instead of <color=red><obstacle></color>, the object
    <color=red><enemy></color>, then Win will not come close. But if the enemy blocks
    your path, then Win can attack himself, for this you need to write the command
    <color=red><attack></color> and after this word write the direction where to
    hit. To use this command, you need to study the stun gun in the "Improvements"
    section

    Example:

    <color=orange>attack right</color>'
