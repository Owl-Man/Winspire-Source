  name: Basic concepts of construction
  content: 'To create a construction, you must first declare the type of the construction.
    There are 2 such types: <color=red><if></color> and <color=red><while></color>,
    the type <color=red><if></color> checks the condition and executes the command
    only once. Next, in parentheses, you need to write <color=red>construction condition</color>:
    first, the direction is set (<color=red><right>, <left>, <top></color> or <color=red><bottom
    ></color>), then the object

    (<color=red><obstacle></color>). After creating
    a construction, you can write commands in it, which will be executed only if
    the condition is met. To mark the end of the construction, after you have written
    everything you need inside, you need to write the command <color=red><construction
    end></color>.

    Example:

    <color=orange>if (top obstacle)

    right

    end</color>'
