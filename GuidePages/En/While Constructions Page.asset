  content: 'The type <color=red><while></color> is a loop that runs until the condition
    is satisfied.

    Example #1:

    <color=orange>while (top obstacle)

    right

    end</color>

    You
    can also write a loop that will execute commands indefinitely. To do this, you
    need to enter in the condition <color=red><robot enabled></color>.

    Example
    #2:

    <color=orange>while (robot enabled)

    right

    end</color>

    To
    use this construction, you need to study it in the "Improvements" section.'
